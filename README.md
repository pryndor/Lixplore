Project Status: Initial Development Phase
Start Date: July 2025
Maintainer: Balasubramanian Periannan

## About This Project
This tool is being developed to streamline literature search, review, screening and article extraction, with a strong focus on biomedical and life sciences domains. While it initially supports PubMed, our long-term goal is to integrate with multiple platforms and sources of scientific literature to make literature management more accessible and efficient.

The project is in its early stages and will be updated frequently. We aim to build a fully functional and user-friendly tool that can assist researchers, healthcare professionals, and students in:

Searching academic literature by keyword, PMID, DOI, Keywords, Dates and country and many more filters

Downloading open-access articles (when available)

Managing and reviewing collected papers

Eventually integrating features like metadata parsing, tagging, annotation, and reference exports

## Overview

A collaborative platform for research article discovery, review, and monitoring, designed for both administrators and users. It integrates multiple open sources, supports NLP-powered analysis, and ensures auditability, deduplication, and advanced search functionality.

### Two User Roles

Administrator

Manage users, roles, and permissions

Create login credentials

Control data sources and APIs

Monitor accepted/rejected articles and generate reports

Schedule automated tasks and audits

Export statistics and article data

Centralized storage and secure access

### User

Login to access research articles

Review abstracts, highlight key data, tag, and comment

Accept/reject articles with workflow tracking

Use semantic search, filters, and saved alerts

Export to reference tools like Zotero

Access citation, summaries, and related graphs

Upload/import articles

## Development Timeline
‚úÖ July 2025 ‚Äì Project initiated, PubMed search prototype started

Ongoing ‚Äì Regular improvements, code optimization, and source integrations

## Core Features

Authentication: Separate login portals for admin and users

Data Sources: PubMed, Crossref, OpenAlex, Unpaywall, Springer, bioRxiv, medRxiv, etc.

Search & Filters: PICO framework, MeSH mapping, date range, source type, language

NLP & AI: Named entity recognition (drugs, adverse events), relevance ranking, summarization, semantic search, OCR

Deduplication: SimHash clustering and manual review

Monitoring: Alerts, workflows (AE & signal monitoring), audit logs, provenance tracking

Scheduling: Time-based task automation and periodic review

Export: Reports, PDFs, URLs, and Zotero integration

Security: Role-based access, encrypted storage, usage logging

Collaboration: Notes sharing, tagging, comment threads, version history

### Goals

Build a scalable, secure, and easy-to-use literature mining platform

Support research workflows with advanced AI tools

Integrate public APIs and enable future data adapters

Provide an open framework for academic and clinical research

## Future Plans:

Add support for Springer, CrossRef, Google Scholar, and more

PDF parser for extracting text and metadata
