## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Database Schema
The screening functionality adds several new tables:
- `screening_projects`: Project metadata and settings
- `screening_reviewers`: Reviewer information and roles
- `screening_articles`: Articles linked to projects
- `screening_decisions`: Individual screening decisions
- `screening_conflicts`: Conflict tracking and resolution

### Integration Points
- Seamless integration with existing Lixplore search functionality

- Maintains existing user interface patterns and styling

## üéØ Best Practices

### Project Setup
1. **Clear Criteria**: Define specific, measurable inclusion/exclusion criteria
2. **Pilot Testing**: Screen a small sample to refine criteria
3. **Reviewer Training**: Ensure all reviewers understand the criteria
4. **Regular Meetings**: Schedule progress reviews and conflict resolution

### Screening Process
1. **Consistent Application**: Apply criteria uniformly across all articles
2. **Document Decisions**: Use reason codes and notes for transparency
3. **Regular Backups**: Export progress regularly
4. **Quality Checks**: Monitor inter-rater agreement
